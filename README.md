# Speech-Recognition
# Voice-Activated Wikipedia Search

## Project Overview
The Voice-Activated Wikipedia Search is a Python-based application that enables users to interact with their computer using voice commands. With this project, users can ask questions verbally, and the system retrieves relevant information from Wikipedia, displaying it in the terminal. This repository contains the source code for the project.

## Key Features
- Voice input and speech recognition for user queries.
- Seamless integration with Wikipedia to retrieve information.
- Continuous user interaction until the user chooses to exit.
- Comprehensive error handling for various scenarios.
- Guidance for ambiguous queries.
- User feedback for speech recognition and system issues.
- Terminal-based display of retrieved Wikipedia summaries.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries, including `speech_recognition` and `wikipedia`.
3. Run the project by executing the `search.py` file.
4. Speak your query into the microphone, and the system will provide Wikipedia summaries in the terminal.

## Usage
- Start the program by running `search.py`.
